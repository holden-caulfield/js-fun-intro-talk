Languages you should check if you want to dig on functional programming
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Try at least:

- One statically typed language such as [ML](http://www.smlnj.org/) or [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/). If you want to check both, start with ML as it is simpler.
- One dynamically typed such as [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) or any other Lisp/Scheme dialect
- You could try [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), it is a cool language. However, keep in mind it's a hybrid and complex one, thus not really the best for a first timer approach to functional programming

Javascript libraries
--------------------

There are a lot of them around. The ones that I found more interesting are:

- For general functional programming
  - [Fn.js](http://eliperelman.com/fn.js/)
  - [Bacon](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js)
  - [Wu](http://fitzgen.github.io/wu.js/)
  - [Fnky](https://github.com/leoasis/fnky)
  - [Prelude](http://preludels.com/)
- For promises and reactive programming
  - [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q)
  - [RSVP](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)
  - [FutureJS](https://github.com/FuturesJS/FuturesJS)
  - [Promised-io](https://github.com/kriszyp/promised-io)
  - [Bacon](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js)
